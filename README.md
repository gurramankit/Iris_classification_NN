# Iris Classification with Neural Network

## Overview
This project uses a neural network to classify iris species (Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica) based on sepal and petal dimensions. Using the Iris dataset, it demonstrates neural networks' capabilities in handling simple classification tasks effectively.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)
- **Features**: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
- **Classes**: Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica

## Problem Statement
To predict the species of an iris plant based on its sepal and petal measurements by training a neural network.

## Project Tasks
### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Examined features and relationships.
- Normalized feature values to improve model training.

### 2. Model Building and Training
- Developed a neural network to classify iris species.
- Trained and fine-tuned the model to optimize accuracy.

### 3. Evaluation
- Evaluated the model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualizations.

## Results
- The neural network model achieved high accuracy in classifying the three species of Iris.
